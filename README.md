# Neural Network for Beginners

Build Deep Neural Networks and Develop Strong Fundamentals using Python’s NumPy, and Matplotlib

This is the repository for [Neural Network for Beginners](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/neural-network-for-beginners?_pos=1&_sid=28eda3397&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
Deep learning helps you solve issues related to data problems as it has a vast array of mathematical algorithms and has capacity to detect patterns.

This book starts with a quick view of deep learning in Python which would include definition, features and applications. You would be learning about perceptron, neural networks, Backpropagation. This book would also give you a clear insight of how to use Numpy and Matplotlin in deep learning models. 

By the end of the book, you’ll have the knowledge to apply the relevant technologies in deep learning.

## What you will learn
* To develop deep learning applications, use Python with few outside inputs.
* Study several ideas of profound learning and neural networks
* Learn how to determine coefficients of learning and weight values
* Explore applications such as automation, image generation and reinforcement learning
* Implement trends like batch Normalisation, dropout, and Adam
